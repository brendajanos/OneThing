How to use?

The usage of The One Thing is pretty easy, first you have to type your focus question at the input field, its neccesary so you cannot start
the timer without a question. Then you could customize the three timers - the timers basically setup with 25, 5 and 10 minutes - the first one is
the main Pomodoro timer, the second one is responsible for the short breaks, and the third one is for the long breaks. If dont like the layout,
you could customize the app by choosing other font types from the list, or you could switch beetween the light and the dark mode.
After you pressed the Set Timer button you could start the pomodoro timer anytime with the Start button, or pause it if you have to, with the Pause button. Below your focus question you could select beetween your short or long break, or changing your options anytime with the Settings button.
